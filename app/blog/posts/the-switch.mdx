my website and blog was initially built on astro and posts were managed using tinacms. while this setup worked well overall, i encountered some inconveniences along the way. when i found the motivation to switch to next.js, i jumped at the opportunity.

### The Flow

previously, making a post on tinacms would trigger a push to github and a rebuild on my server. however, i often forgot about remote pushes when working locally, leading to occasional hiccups. additionally, formatting markdown files for presentability was a hassle.

### The Switch

transitioning to next.js eliminated the need for a third-party cms. now, i manage my posts locally as markdown files (.mdx), ensuring i'm always working with the latest content. this switch allowed me to focus more on content creation. furthermore, streamlining the website by removing image assets and unnecessary styles improved its speed and efficiency. next.js also simplified generating open graph images, a task that was more cumbersome with astro.

### The Inspiration

i replicated the design of the next.js portfolio starter kit provided by the vercel team which can be found [here](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit) with a few additional pages to suit my needs.

### The Conclusion

in conclusion, the switch to next.js has been a game-changer. not only have i streamlined my workflow, but i've also improved the performance and aesthetics of my website. with a leaner setup and enhanced features, i'm excited to continue developing and sharing content.

and that will be all âœ¨
