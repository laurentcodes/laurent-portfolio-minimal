after publishing my blog and the introduction post, having dark mode was suggested to me and i jumped right into it, since the site is using tailwind, implementing this was quite straight forward and interesting.

### Getting Started

tailwind has a "class" strategy to easily manage this easily by setting darkMode to class in the tailwind config as below:

```javascript
module.exports = {
	darkMode: 'class',
	// ...
};
```

after this; we can setup our project to check for and watch for dark mode changes in the browser and also set the **"dark"** class to our main **html** tag in the project which tailwind uses to manage and toggle the dark: selector class.

### Setting Up the Dark Mode Watcher

a rough implementation of a function that checks for the color scheme and sets it accordingly while still watching for changes to the scheme (like switching the device to/from light mode) using the **"window\.matchMedia() API"** is seen below. on astro, this code was added to the **script:inline** tag in the **head** tag of my **Layout.astro** file

```javascript
const applyDarkMode = () => {
	const applyDark = () => {
		const applyTheme = () => {
			if (
				localStorage.theme === 'dark' ||
				(!('theme' in localStorage) &&
					window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches)
			) {
				document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
			} else {
				document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark');
			}
		};

		applyTheme();

		window
			.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')
			.addEventListener('change', applyTheme);
	};

	applyDark();
};

applyDarkMode();
```

### Conclusion

once this is set in place; we are now set to go ahead and make use of the tailwind **dark:** selector wherever we need such as:

```html
<main class="bg-white dark:bg-red-500">...</main>
```

and for this particular website; the color mode changes according to the color scheme of your device, as detected from the watcher above.
