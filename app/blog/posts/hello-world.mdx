welcome to my blog, i plan to do a little bit of writing this year so let's see how it goes ðŸ˜…

i will be doing a little bit of everything, ranting, sharing what i know both code and non-code related topics.

this will also be my personal repository and knowledge base for things i learn and issues i face along the way so i can come back to them and hopefully they can also help someone out (yes, you're welcome).

also, sorry in advance but my content could be a little scattered as i'm always so interested in so many things, but the major focus would be on software development.

once again, **welcome to my blog.**
